Code to identify the number of fingers raised and order the treadmill to move to a certain position

The idea of ​​the project was to learn how to deal with AI, integrating it with actuators (in this case the DC motor that controls the treadmill).
The completion of the project gave my university group greater clarity about the different possible areas of action in which AI can be used.

Here is a link to some demo videos and final documentation:
